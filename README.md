# OBS_switcher_teensy
Simple keyboard to switch Open Broadcast sources in a scene (or any other key command)
Built using the [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) which is way overkill for this project, but I had one laying around.

Keycodes are from [USB HID Keyboard scan codes](https://gist.github.com/MightyPork/6da26e382a7ad91b5496ee55fdc73db2) with additional information on funciton keys and other device inputs from the [USB spec](http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/Hut1_12v2.pdf).
